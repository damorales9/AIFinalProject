https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand

Data set includes an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the "Poker Hand". The order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4.

Problem Type: Supervised Learning

There are 11 attributes to each set and the  order goes:
1.Suit of card 1
2.Rank of card 1
3.Suit of card 2
4.Rank of card 2
5.Suit of card 3
6.Rank of card 3
7.Suit of card 4
8.Rank of card 4
9.Suit of card 5
10.Rank of card 5
11.Class “Poker Hand”
	Ordinal (0-9)

	1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards 
	2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards
